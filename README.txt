This is your cs 401 / 501 workspace. For each new lab N, you will create a labN folder and copy 'submit.py' into that folder (and nothing else). Then, you should run this script from that folder and input the username and password I sent you by email. You will do this for each new lab and project in order to initialize the starter for that lab/project. Follow the instructions to submit your finished (or partly finished) code and have it graded.

Remember, if you have any issues, please let me know by email right away. It is your responsibility to submit your final code to Canvas as well, and let me know if you believe it requires manual grading  (due to a problem with the autograder).

Before you begin, you should be sure you have at least clang++, python 3.7, and pip3 installed, and then you may need to install a few packages for Python3 as shown below. 

$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.0
$ pip3 --version
pip 18.0 from /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
$ pip3 install requests PyInquirer colorama prettytable
